This model uses Ensemble Learning technique to predict the survivors in titanic dataset. It consists of significant feature engineering and transformation of the given features, removing the outliers using interquartile range, Grid Search for parameter tuning and in the end applying the voting classifier to the transformed data using SVC, Random Forest Classifier, XGB Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
